## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## 2. Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

 For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
	
 Which Countries hosts the well paid developper in this survey?
 
 Is there any luck of finding any student with good developper's salaries?
 
 What are developer's job satisfaction and carreer satisfaction per Country?
 
	
## 3. File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. It is  exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown  cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## 4. Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@franciskongolo2002/which-country-hosts-more-developers-in-the-world-and-well-paid-73aec5b71ea3).

## 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
